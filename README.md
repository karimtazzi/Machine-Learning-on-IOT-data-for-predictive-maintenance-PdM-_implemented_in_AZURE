## Overview

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a proactive maintenance strategy that uses data-driven insights to predict equipment failures before they occur. This project focuses on applying **machine learning techniques to IoT data** collected from industrial machines to predict failures and perform necessary maintenance efficiently. The project is fully implemented and tested in **Microsoft Azure** using five different datasets.

## Datasets

The project processes the following five datasets:

1. **Telemetry** – Sensors data collected from machines.
2. **Errors** – Error logs generated by the machines.
3. **Maintenance** – Historical maintenance records.
4. **Failures** – Historical machine failure records.
5. **Machines** – Metadata related to each machine (e.g., model, age).

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter notebook in this repository includes **5 Python scripts** that handle the following key aspects of the data pipeline:

1. **Feature Engineering** – Creating and transforming features from raw datasets to make them suitable for machine learning models.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding the relationships between features and visualizing important trends in the data.

These scripts have been **verified in Azure** and demonstrate the functionality of the entire data processing pipeline.

## Feature Engineering & EDA

- **Feature Engineering**: This section focuses on generating machine learning features from raw IoT datasets like telemetry, errors, and maintenance data. Various techniques such as aggregation, merging, and time-series transformations are applied.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analyses are applied to understand patterns, correlations, and potential insights from the data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Azure account** (if testing within Azure)
- **Required Python libraries** (these will be mentioned in the notebook):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - etc.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning-on-IOT-data-for-predictive-maintenance-PdM-_implemented_in_AZURE.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PdM_Azure.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells to process the datasets and perform feature engineering and EDA.

## Azure Integration

This project was developed and tested on **Azure** to leverage its powerful data processing capabilities and scalability. If you're running this project in Azure:

1. Make sure to have the necessary Azure resources set up (e.g., storage, compute instances).
2. You can upload the notebook to **Azure Notebooks**, or use **Azure Machine Learning** services for training models based on the processed data.
   
All scripts are optimized for use within the **Azure environment** and have shown reliable performance when processing large datasets.
